## Deep Learning for Image Inpainting

Benchmark:
https://learnopencv.com/image-inpainting-with-opencv-c-python/
Classical Inpainting methods: NS method and TELEA method

:: What metric to measure inpainting?
Dice Score or IoU

Discussion on transition from Classical to DL methods for Image Inpainting:

Inpainted images have to be visually as well as semantically consistent
1. U Net like Autoencoder
Uses Max Pooling and Transpose layers in the encoder and decoder respectively
